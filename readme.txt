ImageRecycle pdf & image compression. Make your WordPress website load faster by using an automatic image and pdf optimization.

== Description ==

**ImageRecycle is an automatic Image and PDF content optimizer for WordPress website.** Your customers are waiting for your pages to load, it can takes long, especially on mobile devices. Even content is served fast by the server, slow connection can make your users leaving.

People are impatient in front a slow loading website, that's the result of a recent study, 4 second loading causing 24% of visitors to leave (Source statistica.com.). Content optimization is more efficient than any other optimization tool.


### WordPress image optimization

Images can represent from 60% to 80% of a page weight, so an optimization can accelerate your page loading by x3 or more.
With an average of 25% of users that leave your website after 4 second of loading page, this is something crucial for your online business. And it's even more important on mobile devices were connection are usually slower.


### Reduce image and pdf, not quality

The jpg, png, gif optimization algorithm is capable of reducing the image size by up to 85% (5x +), while the resulting photos are visually identical to the originals. We believe that image and pdf compression is a matter preserving the quality then reduce the size. Reducing the image and pdf size can be done using a massive compression of data and result a worsened quality. We detect already compressed media and return original files.

### WooCommerce and third party plugin compatible

The plugin is highly configurable and you can choose media from any folder on your FTP.
So it will works with all third party plugins including WooCommerce. Plus, you can of course optimize media from other folders (multiple site, other CMS,...)
